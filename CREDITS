==================================================================================================================================

Credits to Yueliang for the Lua bytecode interperter and FiOne for the Interperter to actually execute the bytecode. They are the
reason of how we made our Lua Virtual Machine very fast! (more than 10x faster than LuaInLua which Scriptable)

NOTE: Also credits to ScrapVM! Why? Because we are actually using the yueliang from them because for some reason there is no github
repo. and i could only fine one at a archive website...
