This LuaVM is custom. The following files are from ScrapVM:
    - LuaK.lua
    - LuaP.lua
    - LuaU.lua
    - LuaX.lua
    - LuaY.lua
    - LuaZ.lua

All of these files in one do 1 thing. Convert lua code to bytecode. But ur
maybe wondering of why not use the LBI.lua from ScrapVM, thats because that
thing is utter garbage. So we are using the FiOne Interpeter for the LBI.

The FiOne is also modified to fix some issues with it.
