# ComputerCodeToWritableCode

### This folder is used to convert code that gets interpettered by the computer to code that u can use in Visual Studio Code

The reason why is because how ScrapComputers handle the \ character due to MyGui interpettering this `Hello \\n` as like this `Hello \[NEW LINE CHARACTER]`.

ScrapComputers converts the code from \ to be this unicode character to prevent MyGui from formatting it: ⁄. But since it does that, Visual Studio code wouldnt understand it so thats what this
script uses to fix it. (By converting the `⁄` uuid to a `\`)

script.py = Converts `⁄` to `\`
script_reverse.py = Converts `\` to`⁄`
