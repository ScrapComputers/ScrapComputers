# How does it work? (--auto flag)

By default. you have to input a font name and the size and it will generate you a SCF font. But theres additional code to generate mass amounts of fonts. Add a --auto parameter and it will generate mass of them. But how does it work?

So on the Fonts folder. you see fonts and text files. Each font has the TTF font and the text file. The text file tells what size it is.

Afther generating them. They will be inside the Generated Folder. The names of the files inside there are the font name.
